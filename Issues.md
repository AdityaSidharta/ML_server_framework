# ISSUES

1. `docker-deploy` should access the ip address of the different containers via docker-compose. This behaviour is still fail
2. Fill data should utilize the localhost port mapping in performing the operation.
3. docker-deploy should be able to patiently wait until model is uploaded to docker-minio.
